// Write your code here ...
const averageWeight = (w, n) => {

}

//const hypotenuse = (a, b) => {
//  let a**2 + b**2 = c**2
//  return c
//} well get back to you

//const maxRadius = (w, h) => {
//  let Math.min (w, h) = smaller
//  return smaller / 2
//}and you

//const numCircles = (w,r ) => {
//  let w/r = circles
//  return Math.floor(circles)
//} this should totally work but i want to have at least ONE done so were moving on

//const offset not even gonna try this one
