} // damn i really did just stare out the window for half an hour fuck me
// i feel as if i am so incredibly close but just missing like one or two itty bitty detailes to make it all come together
// i know i cant have the let be xs as its already consted but when i make the let something else xs is never read in the actual function, making it useless
// idk man shits fucked
