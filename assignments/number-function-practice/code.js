const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b
} // starting small

const averageOfThree = (a, b, c) => {
  return (a + b + c) / 3
}; // getting better

// i just spent the last 15 mins trying to do a cool thing with like let loops and shit and then realised its the exact same as

const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b
} // it would have been cool tho, trust me

const addButThenAddOneMore = (a, b) => {
  return (a + b) + 1
}; // i thought it would be funny, could be shortened to just addOneMore

const nothing = (a) => {
  return (a)
}; // i read your thing on the PR, sad i cant fufill my true creative vision but this will have to do

const cubed = (a) => {
  return a**3
};
