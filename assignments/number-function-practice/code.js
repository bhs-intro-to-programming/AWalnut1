const add = (a, b) => {
  return a+b
} // starting small

const averageOfThree = (a,b,c) => {
  return (a+b+c) / 3
}; // getting better

// i just spent the last 15 mins trying to do a cool thing with like let loops and shit and then realised its the exact same as

const multiply = (a,b) => {
  return a*b
} // it would have been cool tho, trust me

const addButThenAddOneMore = (a,b) => {
  return (a+b)+1
}; // i thought it would be funny

const nothing = (a,b) => {
  return (a),(b)
};
